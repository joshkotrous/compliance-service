Hi Chris and team 👋 thanks for reviewing my solution to this portion of the interview process! Within this repository you will find the following files and folders:

```

- `ADR/ADR.md` - Architecture decision record. I notated key architecture decisions I made while designing this service and included my rationale and considerations.
- `Data Schema/compliance-service-input-schema.json` - the data schema of the input to be provided to the Compliance Service.
- `Data Schema/compliance-service-output-schema.json` - the data schema of the output to be returned by the Compliance Service.
- `Data Schema/state-configuration-schema.json` - the data schema of the configuration file we will store for each state.
- `Diagrams/Nabis Compliance Service - System Diagram.pdf` - diagrams to show the design of the system organized into Level 0 and Level 1 aggregation levels.
- `Project Proposal.pdf` - a set of slides summarizing the solution design, project management considerations, and how I would ensure the successful and timely delivery.
- `Solution/compliance-service` - my source code for the compliance service module.
  - `compliance-service/state_configuration` - Temporary state configuration data store for unit tests.
  - `compliance-service/tests` - unit tests for the compliance service built using Jest.
- `Solution/example` - an example of an app importing and invoking the Compliance Service.
  - The state configuration files are stored in `example/state_configuration` to represent the external state config data store. These can be updated with new fields to showcase the configuration capabilities.
  - The compliance service module has been published to npm and installed in the example. You can run the example with (requires `Node v20`):
    - `cd solution/example`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`
- `Solution/lambda-layer.zip` - the layer I deployed to AWS Lambda for the API example.
- `Solution/lambda.zip` - the Lambda I built for the API example that consumes the compliance service layer.

I look forward to diving into my proposed solution and hearing your feedback and questions!

**Update July 28:** Since I had some more time to spend on this over the weekend, I experimented with making the module portable to AWS as a Lambda layer and deployed it to a public API. You can try it out with a `POST` request to `https://w3yh6cyjkggzpsn6dcm5tchokm0fxevg.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/` with the following body:

```
{
  "product": {
      "productId": "4e7a3c97-8dcd-4d8d-a9f8",
      "productName": "Skywalker OG",
      "strain": "sativa",
      "netWeight": "3.5g",
      "thcContent": "28.4%",

      "manufacturingDate": "06-24-2024"
    },
    "states": ["NY", "CA", "NV"]
}
```

**Update July 31:** With the additional time I had I added unit tests built with Jest to the compliance service module. These unit tests could be ran from the CI/CD pipeline when new PRs are opened and/or merged to ensure breaking changes never make it into the repository. The unit tests can be ran with:

- `cd solution/compliance-service`
- `npm install`
- `npm test`

Thanks,\
